                    <h5> Plot</h5>

                    <p>Recently, I watched The Office (US) in Netflix after being recommended by many of my friends. Instantly I became a fan of the show and I am currently
                        binge watching it for the second time. The Office (US) debuted in 2005 as an american adaptation of the hit british show of the same name. It features 
                        a documentary style storytelling of the employees in  a Scarnton based paper company called Dunder Mifflin.
                        </p>
                    
                    <h5>Cast</h5>
                    <p>Steve Carell plays the lead character of Michael Scott, the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin. Rainn Wilson plays the role of quirky sales associate Dwight Schrute.
                        The characters Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly portrayed by John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer provides the central love interest in the show. Rashida Jones and Ed Helms joined
                        the cast in the latter seasons. Except for these main characters, the show features a very strong group of supporting characters. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Strength: the writing and the cast</h4>
                    <p>The writing of the show is its backbone. Over the course of 9 seasons, many writers were involved in the show : Mindy Kaling, Ricky Gervais, Michael Schur, Greg Daniels, 
                        Ryan Koh, Daniel Chun, Lee Eisenberg, Gene Stupnitsky. The main characters are written very well and the supporting cast blend in the story effortlessly. The tone of 
                        season 1 feels pretty different than other seasons. But personally I enjoy season 1 as much as any other seasons. The writing
                        has been consistent over the seasons especially from Seasons 1 to 7. After the departure of Stevel Carell during Season 7, the show's quality did dip a bit but I really
                        enjoyed how the story progressed after then end of Michael Scott's story and towards the finale.
                    </p>

                    <p> The cast provides full justice to the writers. Steve Carell is a major reason why the show is a comedic masterpiece. He plays Michael Scott with great depth, with right
                        amount of emotions, humor and awkwardness. You just know why the office is, in most part, a Michael Scott show when Carell leaves the show.  
                    </p>
